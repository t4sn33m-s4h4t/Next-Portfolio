            I'm Tasneem Sahat, a web developer with a focus on <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>React</b> and <b>NextJs</b> . 
            I’m passionate about building clean, responsive web applications that provide a seamless user experience. My goal is 
            to always stay updated with the latest trends in front-end development and enhance my skills.

          I am particularly drawn to problem-solving and logic-based challenges, which is why competitive programming fascinates me. In web development, I love creating seamless, user-friendly applications that are both functional and visually appealing. These two fields allow me to combine creativity and logic, which is something I find both challenging and fulfilling.
          I find joy in solving coding challenges and continuously learning new technologies.Outside of programming, I have a strong interest in math, writing, and debating. I find math to be a great way to sharpen my problem-solving skills, while writing and debating help me refine my communication and critical thinking abilities. These hobbies also offer me a well-rounded perspective, which I apply to my programming projects.
